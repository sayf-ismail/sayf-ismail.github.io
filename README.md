This Tic Tac Toe project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. They can be played at these links:

https://sayf-ismail.github.io/version1_2/tictactoeV2.html

There are two versions, where V1 meets the basic requirements of the project, and V2 is a fun take on the game.

Challenges faced included:
- Logic for gameplay
- eventListener nested if-statements
- Understanding the removeChild line and where it can be used
- Removing player ability to click on populated boxes

Overall this was a great way to practice skills in Javascript, and the Document Object Model specifically.
