This Tic Tac Toe project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

There are two versions, where V1 meets the basic requirements of the project, and V2 is a fun take on the game.

Challenges faced included:
- Logic for gameplay
- eventListener nested if-statements
- Understanding the removeChild line and where it can be used
- Removing player ability to click on "taken" boxes

Overall this was a great way to practice skills in Javascript, and the Document Object Model specifically.
