This Tic Tac Toe project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

There are two versions: 
- V1 ( https://sayf-ismail.github.io/tictactoe.html)
- V2 (https://sayf-ismail.github.io/version1_2/tictactoeV2.html)

Challenges faced included:

- Logic for gameplay on/off
- Refactoring and making decisions to use functions
- eventListener nested if-statements
- Understanding the removeChild line and where it can be used
- Removing player ability to click on populated boxes

Overall this was a great way to practice skills in Javascript, and the Document Object Model in particular.
