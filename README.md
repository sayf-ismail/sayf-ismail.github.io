1. TIC TAC TOE

Tic Tac Toe project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

There are two versions: 
- V1 ( https://sayf-ismail.github.io/tictactoe.html)
- V2 (https://sayf-ismail.github.io/version1_2/tictactoeV2.html)

Challenges faced, and how I tackled them:

- Logic for gameplay "on/off" functionality needed to be implemented. I created a boolean variable that allowed me to "switch" the game "on/off", and I inserted this into the relevant functions.
- When I realised refactoring was necessary, I took a bit longer to plan and making decisions to make use of functions for repeated code. This helped with managing readability for buttons and eventListeners.
- I had trouble removing children from parent Nodes because of type issues. What helped was eventually understanding that "removeChild" needed an element node as an argument.
- For a while I had issues with boxes still being clicked after the game was "over", and I needed to figure out how to remove player ability to click on populated boxes. I created a function that I could insert in relevant areas that checked for gameplay "off".

Other ways I solved for general problems were:

- Getting help from wiser teachers 
- Googling
- W3Schools
- Good old trial and error!

Overall this was a great way to practice skills in Javascript, and the Document Object Model in particular.
